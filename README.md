# bodice_drafter
jlbellan 15-112 - Takes a person's measurements and drafts a bodice sloper for creating fitted garment patterns.

The important files are drafter.py, smoother_measurements.csv, and graphics 2.py.
You'll need to download smoother_measurements.csv and change line 65 of drafter.py for it
to run. The video I submitted was from before I transferred to graphics 2, so please run
it to get a better demo of the UI. It's still not complete, but it's better.
